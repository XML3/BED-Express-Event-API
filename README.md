# Express Events API - ORM - Node.js/Express, Prisma

This Back-end Express API project is the backbone of the Events management system (Front-end project/Events). 

It manages the database, enabling posting, editing, and deletion of events by event creators through token authorization.  Additionally, it handles the contact form functionality using nodemailer, facilitating communication between users and App managers. 

Furthermore, it manages image uploads by event organizers, ensuring they are efficiently hosted on an image hosting site for their respective events.  
It integrates with the front-end solution to deliver a comprehensive event management experience.
